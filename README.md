# Work in progress

Replication repository for ongoing project examining the moral foundations of police social media posts in Canada

### Notes
- Extract hashtags and handles
- Filter out RT tweets
- Verify language detected by twitter
- Duplicated tweets -- look into this
- Normalize spellings? (u, brrrrave, etc.)
- Drop short tweets after cutting hashtags and handles
- Remove loaded words that are unfair (i.e. service)?
